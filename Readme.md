## 📦 Smart Inventory Management

### Intelligent Duplicate Detection
The system uses a **flexible two-strategy approach** to detect duplicate books:

**Strategy 1: ISBN Matching** (for international books)
- If ISBN is provided, system checks for exact ISBN match
- Best for books with standard ISBN codes

**Strategy 2: Title + Author Matching** (for local books)
- If no ISBN or ISBN not found, checks Title + Author combination
- Case-insensitive matching
- Perfect for local books without ISBN

**Adding a New Book:**
- System checks both strategies automatically
- If **new**: Creates new book entry with initial stock
- If **exists**: Updates stock quantity instead of creating duplicate
- Returns clear feedback about how the match was found

**Examples:**
```
International Book (with ISBN):
Adding "The Great Gatsby" (ISBN: 978-0743273565)
- First time: ✅ New book created with 50 units
- Second time: ⚠️ Book exists (matched by ISBN). Stock updated: 50 → 80 units

Local Book (without ISBN):
Adding "සිංහල කවි" by "මාර්ටින් වික්‍රමසිංහ"
- First time: ✅ New book created with 30 units
- Second time: ⚠️ Book exists (matched by Title and Author). Stock updated: 30 → 60 units
```

```

### Complete Stock Movement Tracking
Every inventory change is recorded with:
- **Movement Type**: INITIAL_STOCK, RESTOCK, SALE, ADJUSTMENT, RETURN
- **Quantity Changes**: Before and after amounts
- **User Attribution**: Who made the change
- **Timestamp**: Exact date and time
- **Reason/Notes**: Why the change was made
- **Value Tracking**: Unit price and total value

### Inventory Batches
Track different stock batches with:
- Batch numbers and quantities
- Purchase and selling prices
- Supplier information
- Received and expiry dates

### Stock Adjustments
- Manual stock corrections for damages, losses, or returns
- Requires reason for complete audit trail
- Prevents negative stock quantities
- Full user accountability

### Audit Trail Benefits
- ✅ **No Duplicates** - System prevents duplicate book entries
- ✅ **Complete History** - Track every stock movement
- ✅ **User Accountability** - Know who made each change
- ✅ **Loss Prevention** - Track damages and adjustments
- ✅ **Compliance Ready** - Full audit trail for reporting

## 💾 Database & Data Safety


### ACID-Compliant Transactions
The system uses SQLite with **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** for maximum data safety:

**Configuration**:
- `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` - Crash-proof logging
- `PRAGMA synchronous = FULL` - Maximum durability
- `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` - Referential integrity

**Transaction Safety**:
- ✅ **Completed sales are always saved**
- ✅ **Incomplete sales are never saved** (automatic rollback on crash)
- ✅ **No partial transactions** - All-or-nothing guarantee
- ✅ **No inventory mismatches** - Stock always matches sales
- ✅ **Automatic crash recovery** - No manual intervention needed

**How it works**:
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  → Validate all items
  → Create sales record
  → Insert sale items
  → Update inventory
  → COMMIT (if successful)
  → ROLLBACK (if error or crash)
```

### Database Tables
- **books** - Inventory catalog
- **sales** - Completed transactions
- **sales_items** - Transaction details
- **stock_movements** - Complete inventory movement history
- **inventory_batches** - Stock batch tracking
- **users** - User accounts
- **user_activity_logs** - User activity audit trail
- **price_history** - Price change tracking
